R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.0 and R development 
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This is a re-submission of the same version (v0.6.0) with a fix to some 
URLs in man files that were giving a 502 response. They must have been 
temporarily down.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
