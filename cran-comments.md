R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.2 and 
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This submission includes some defunct functions for online data 
services that are no longer online; and minor improvements, and 
bug fixes. 

Thanks! 
Scott Chamberlain
